	<h2>Slovak Wedding traditions</h2>  
     
	<h3>The breaking of the plate/glass</h3>
    <p>A tradition in Slovakia is to break a plate/glass as the bride and groom enter the venue, and for them to sweep it up together.</p>

	<p>The breaking of the plate/glass is considered good luck, and the sweeping together symbolises co-operation in the marriage</p>
	
	<h3>Traditional dance with the Bride and Groom</h3>
	
	<p>All guests put a small contribution for the Bride and Groom into a basket, and for this they get shot of Brandy and a dance with the Bride or Groom. The contributions are traditionally used to help the Bride and Groom setup their home.</p>
                                           
	<p>There are more traditions, but we'll leave them as a surprise!</p>
